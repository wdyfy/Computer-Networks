# Chapter 3 Transport Layer

## 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

There are two distinct transport-layer protocols available to the application layer:

**UDP**\(User Datagram Protocol\): provides an unreliable, connectionless service to the invoking application.

**TCP**\(Transmission Control Protocol\): provides a reliable, connection-oriented service to the invoking application.

The most fundamental responsibility of UDP and TCP is to extend IP's delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two process running on the end systems. Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing.
